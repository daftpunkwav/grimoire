# Contributing

This guide is the onboarding layer for contributors. Every rule here points at
a single-source document; when prose and code disagree, the code and the
quality gates (`scripts/check-*.mjs`) win.

## Environment

- Node.js >= 20.9 (`engines` in the root `package.json`; `.nvmrc` pins the
  exact release) and pnpm 11 (the `packageManager` field pins the exact
  release).
- **Windows is the reference platform.** CI runs on `windows-latest` because
  several suites (process-runner, sandbox, file-lock jitter) are Win32-only;
  on another OS the security-relevant cases skip. Development on other
  platforms works for most packages, but the platform-gated tests will not
  run there.
- `pnpm install` at the repo root, then configure the per-workspace `.env`
  (never committed). Environment keys are documented in
  [docs/reference/configuration.md](docs/reference/configuration.md); a
  first-run walkthrough is
  [docs/guides/getting-started.md](docs/guides/getting-started.md).

## Workflow

1. Branch from `main` as `<type>/<kebab-case-description>`, e.g.
   `feat/annotation-acl`.
2. Commit with Conventional Commits: `<type>: <subject>` where `type` is
   `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `refactor`, `chore`, `test`, or `perf`; the subject
   is imperative, at most 50 characters, and one commit carries one concern.
3. Keep every diff traceable to its change; do not refactor unrelated code
   in passing. The full conventions live in [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md).

## Before you push: quality gates

```bash
pnpm verify                                # build + typecheck + coverage + boundaries + check:deps + check:exports
pnpm --filter @grimoire/web lint           # web oxlint, after UI code changes
pnpm --filter @grimoire/web check:i18n     # web i18n gate, after front-end copy changes
```

What each gate owns and what a failure means:
[docs/operations/quality-gates.md](docs/operations/quality-gates.md). CI runs
the same gates on `windows-latest`, plus a `smoke` job that boots the real
server binary and probes it over HTTP.

## Tests

- Run from the repo root: `pnpm test`, or `pnpm test:coverage` for the
  threshold-gated run. Test strategy and budgets:
  [docs/operations/testing.md](docs/operations/testing.md).
- Placement: a single-package test belongs in that package's own `tests/`;
  only genuinely multi-package flows go under the root `tests/` journeys.
  The placement rules are in [tests/README.md](tests/README.md).
- Coverage thresholds are a gate: a red coverage gate means restore the
  tests, not lower the numbers.

## Docs and copy

- A behavior change updates the documentation pair. `docs/` mirrors the code
  in English and Simplified Chinese (see [docs/README.md](docs/README.md)
  for the map).
- Code and comments are English-only. User-visible UI copy lives in the
  i18n catalogs under `apps/web/src/i18n/catalogs/` — `zh-CN` canonical,
  `en` type-pinned, never inline — enforced by the `check:i18n` gate.

## Submitting

- One concern per pull request, gates green, and the behavior delta
  described in the body. CI (`verify` + `smoke`) must pass.
- Extension how-tos live in `docs/guides/`:
  [add-a-service](docs/guides/add-a-service.md),
  [add-a-package](docs/guides/add-a-package.md).
